            Scorsese Has Rethought Violence</h1>

        <p>The director was long identified with ornately edited set pieces. In “The Irishman” and his latest<br>
            film, the flourishes have given way to blunt truths. </p>

       <p>Of all the haunting images and disturbing sounds that permeate Martin Scorsese's
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/movies/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-martin-scorsese.html" target=_blank">"Killers of the<br>Flower Moon,"</a>
       none is more upsetting than the guttural cry from Mollie Burkhart (Lily<br>
       Gladstone), a tortured wail of rage and grief that escapes her reserved visage when tragedy<br>
       strikes. And it often does: “Killers” tells the true story, adapted from the book by David Grann,<br>
       of how Mollie’s Osage community was decimated by murderous white men, who killed dozens<br>
       of her tribe members for rights to their oil-rich land.</p>
       <p>Mollie’s howl of pain is not quite like any sound heard before in a Scorsese film. But in many<br>
        ways, Scorsese is emulating her jarring cry in the ominous aesthetics of “Killers of the Flower<br>
        Moon” itself, and of his 2019 feature, “The Irishman.”</p>
