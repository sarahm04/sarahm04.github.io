            <p>The phrase <i>Eras</i> has been used by Taylor Swift and her fans to describe the change in style and vibe between
            her different album cycles. Her recent record-breaking tour, <i>The Ears Tour</i> was named for this concept and reflects the time and music of each of these eras.</p>

            <p>Each era is titled after the coresponding album that was released during that time. Swift has ten mejor studio albums; 
                <i>Taylor Swift</i> (2006), <i>Fearless</i> (2008), <i>Speak Now</i> (2010), <i>Red</i> (2012), <i>1989</i> (2014), 
                <i>Reputation</i> (2017), <i>Lover</i> (2019), <i>folklore</i> (2020), <i>evermore</i> (2020), and <i>Midnights</i> (2022).
                <i>Fearless, Speak Now, Red,</i> and <i>1989</i> have all been rerecorded by Swift between in 2021 or 2023 following a dispute
                with her former record label that ended with her not having ownership over her original masters.

            <p>Each era is associated with its own vibe, colors, and aesthetic that originate from the album sound and art, Taylor's 
                outfits and actions during the time, and from the tours. For example, <i>Fearless</i> is associated with the color gold and youth,
                while <i>Reputation</i> has a lot of snake imagery and centers on revenge. <b>Follow the links above to learn more
